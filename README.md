This repository contains the code, and the databases, used for the experimental analysis of the ranged k-median algorithm presented in the master thesis "Range-Centric Coresets in Dynamic Geometric Streams". The experiments for the blobs, Twitter, and Gowalla datasets can be accessed by running the corresponding Python scripts.
